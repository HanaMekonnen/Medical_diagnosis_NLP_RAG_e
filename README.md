Project Overview / Objective

Workplace safety in high-risk environments like construction sites and industrial zones is a top priority. One critical safety requirement is ensuring that workers wear helmets to prevent head injuries from falling objects or machinery. However, manual monitoring is inefficient and prone to human error, especially in large-scale operations.

To address this, SafeGuard Corp initiated a project to build an automated helmet detection system using computer vision. Developing a binary image classification model capable of categorizing images as either ‚ÄúWith Helmet‚Äù or ‚ÄúWithout Helmet.‚Äù The objective was to deploy a robust, scalable solution that could operate reliably across various environmental and activity-based conditions.

Approach & Implementation

I took a step-by-step approach to ensure model accuracy, robustness, and practical relevance:

üîπ 1. Data Setup and Initial Exploration

Installed and imported all necessary Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow).


Loaded the dataset of 631 labeled images: 311 showing workers with helmets and 320 without helmets.


Explored data characteristics, noting variability in lighting, background, worker posture, and activity types.


üîπ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Randomly visualized images from both classes to gain intuitive insights.


Verified class balance to ensure equal representation of categories.


Applied Gaussian blur visualization and grayscale conversion to understand image features more clearly.


üîπ 3. Preprocessing Pipeline

Resized all images to a consistent shape suitable for CNN input.


Converted images to grayscale to test model sensitivity to color.


Normalized both original and grayscale datasets.


Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization.


üîπ 4. Utility Functions and Model Evaluation Criteria

Created reusable utility functions for image processing, visualization, and prediction.


Defined clear evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report) to assess model effectiveness.


üîπ 5. Model Development and Experimentation

Built and evaluated four models:


Model 1: A simple CNN to establish a baseline.


Model 2: Pre-trained VGG-16 (Base) model with frozen layers.


Model 3: VGG-16 + Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) to enhance learning capacity.


Model 4: VGG-16 + FFNN with Data Augmentation, introducing rotated, flipped, and scaled images to improve generalization.


Visualized predictions after each model to interpret results qualitatively and ensure correct classification behavior.


üîπ 6. Model Selection and Testing

Compared performance across all four models using test accuracy and confusion matrices.


Selected the final model (Model 4) based on its superior generalization, especially in varied environments.


Validated on unseen test data to confirm robustness and deployment readiness.
