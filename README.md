# Medical_diagnosis_NLP_RAG_e

Project Overview / Objective

The healthcare industry is facing an urgent need to manage large volumes of complex medical data while enabling accurate, real-time clinical decision-making. Healthcare professionals often struggle with information overload when searching through extensive research and documentation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios like emergency diagnostics or critical care.

To address this, building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI solution using the Merck Manuals‚Äîa 4,000+ page medical reference. The goal was to streamline access to trusted medical knowledge by creating a system that could answer complex diagnostic, drug, and protocol-related questions, enhancing decision-making and standardizing care delivery across the organization.

Approach & Implementation

I followed a structured, step-by-step approach:

üîπ 1. Setup and Initial Experimentation

Installed and imported all necessary libraries and dependencies for NLP and LLM applications.


Implemented a basic LLM-based Q&A pipeline, downloading and loading pre-trained models to generate answers for clinical questions like ‚ÄúWhat are the treatment options for pulmonary embolism?‚Äù


üîπ 2. Prompt Engineering for LLM Q&A

Enhanced the Q&A system using prompt engineering techniques to improve context-awareness and precision in the responses.


Ran several question-answering experiments to benchmark performance before RAG integration.


üîπ 3. Data Preparation for RAG

Loaded the Merck Manual PDF, explored the dataset structure, and verified content integrity by checking the first few pages and total page count.


Performed data chunking to split the manual into manageable sections, ensuring better contextual embedding.


Created embeddings for the chunks and stored them in a vector database.


üîπ 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Implementation

Built a retriever module to fetch relevant documents from the vector store based on user queries.


Designed and implemented a response generation function using both system and user prompt templates to create high-quality, contextual responses.


Integrated the retriever with the LLM to enable full RAG-based Q&A, capable of answering nuanced medical questions using real-time retrieval from the Merck Manual.


üîπ 5. Fine-Tuning and Evaluation

Fine-tuned the LLM with healthcare-specific prompts and evaluated its performance through multiple Q&A iterations.


Analyzed the quality and relevance of responses using both qualitative review and consistency checks.


üîπ 6. Insights and Business Impact

Derived actionable insights around how RAG can assist with diagnostic decision-making, protocol standardization, and drug information retrieval.


Provided business recommendations to deploy this tool in hospital information systems or as part of mobile diagnostic assistants for practitioners.
